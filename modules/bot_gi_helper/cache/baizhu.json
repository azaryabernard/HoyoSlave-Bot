    "notes": "SUPPORT\nCollei is a Bow User who provides off-field support in Dendro application and damage.\n\nRegarding Weapon Choices:\nPolar Star: While this weapon provides the highest personal damage, it is generally not recommended as team buffs provide more teamwide damage over a small increase in personal damage. \nSacrificial Bow: Not recommended below [R4] due to it delaying rotation, possibly resulting in damage loss.\n\nRegarding Artifact Sets: \nTenacity of the Millelith (4): Collei's Sprout damage counts as Skill damage, which allows her to be able to keep Tenacity of the Millelith (4) up during important damage windows. Generally an alternative to Noblesse Oblige (4) or Deepwood Memories (4) (or if you are already running both in a team).\nGilded Dreams (4): This set is only used in a team where Collei is used to trigger reactions (i.e. Bloom/Burning teams), and does not benefit Collei if she is used as an aura. \nThe Exile (4): An alternative option if they are placed in the same team as Cyno to help his Energy Recharge needs.\n\nShout out to Emiliabyss#1641 for providing an in-depth reference.
