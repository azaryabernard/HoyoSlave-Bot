        "In some teams and situations, using Ganyu's Elemental Burst can be detrimental to overall damage due to stealing Pyro aura, thus reducing the amount of CAs melting.",
        "Try to not overcap on Crit Rate (within the range of 25%-45% Crit Rate) since Ganyu's A1 passive only affects her Charged Shot and subsequent Blooms.",
        "When using her Elemental Burst, place her Elemental Skill in the AoE to taunt and keep enemies inside the zone for constant damage.\n\nMake sure to hit enemies with her skill's initial damage and her explosion damage as they both regen energy for her ult."
    ],
    "notes": "MELT DPS\nGanyu's Level 2 Charged Shot applies two instances Cryo as they do not share the same ICD, which allows you to trigger Melt reaction twice for both damage instances. Charged Attack will be the majority of her damage output while neglecting her Skill/Burst damage contribution for most scenarios.\n\nRegarding Weapon Choices:\nAmos' Bow: This is an excellent weapon for Ganyu since her Level 2 Charge Shot Bloom extends arrow flight duration and you can get 3 stacks of Amos' Bow passive even on point blank range.\nHamayumi: Due to its passive, this weapon prefers Wanderer's Troupe (4) instead.\nPrototype Crescent: At higher refinement levels with good uptime on its passive, it can potentially be on par with Skyward Harp. However, do bear in mind that not all enemies have weak spots that you can headshot, which does affect its performance significantly. \n\nRegarding Artifact Sets:\nShimenawa's Reminiscence (4) and Wanderer's Troupe (4): If you are able to squeeze 5 Charged Attacks during the 10 second buff duration, Shimenawa's Reminiscence (4) pulls ahead of Wanderer's Troupe (4). Due to it being very difficult to do, Wanderer's Troupe (4) will usually end up dealing more damage for most players. Note that unless you intend to artifact strongbox Wanderer's Troupe pieces, Shimenawa's Riminiscence (4) remains the better set to farm as the domain is greatly resin efficient.\n\nRegarding Talent Priority:\nGanyu's Elemental Burst is low priority on a Melt Build since most of the times, you don't cast her burst at all so that it doesn't steal your Melt reaction.\n\nFREEZE DPS\nFreeze Ganyu gives a lot of i-frames since you would be spamming Elemental Burst from all of your party members off cooldown. Ganyu's Elemental Burst can deal a ton of damage based on how grouped the enemies are, due to the quadratic scaling on her Elemental Burst.\n\nRegarding Weapon Choices: \nPolar Star: This weapon is much harder to optimize with, due to having a very high Crit Rate stat resulting in your Crit Rate going well above 100%. However, if optimised properly (i.e. very little Crit Rate substats), it pulls quite far ahead of all the other options.\nAqua Simulacra: Due to the sheer amount of Crit stats you can get from Blizzard Strayer (4), Ganyu's ascension passive and this weapon itself, you can consider running an ATK% circlet, especially if it has better substats than your Crit DMG one.\nAmos' Bow: In quickswap heavy rotations (Ganyu Mona Venti Diona) where you usually don't do a lot of Charged Shots, this weapon performs worse than the other 5 star options listed.\nPrototype Crescent: Similar to the Melt Build, this weapon at higher refinement levels and good passive uptime can pull ahead of some of the 5 star options such as Thundering Pulse and Skyward Harp. However, do bear in mind that not all enemies have weak spots that you can headshot, which does affect its performance significantly. \n\nRegarding Artifact Sets:\nBlizzard Strayer (4): This set is the go to set for a Freeze team comp due to the huge stats it provides.\n\nOFF-FIELD DPS\nAn Off-field DPS Ganyu shines brightly on a Freeze comp as she has 100% Elemental Burst uptime and her Elemental Burst buffs party members' Cryo Damage. \n\nRegarding Weapon Choices:\nPrototype Crescent: This weapon might pull ahead of some of the other options if you activate the buff before casting Elemental Burst.\nElegy for the End: Offers party-wide Elemental Mastery and ATK buff which is quite nice on reaction heavy team comps.\n\nRegarding Artifact Sets:\nBlizzard Strayer (4): This set offers a huge amount of stats, use this set only if your Ganyu is used on a Freeze team.\nNoblesse Oblige (4): This set provides Ganyu with more utility so that she can buff your whole party's ATK by 20%."
