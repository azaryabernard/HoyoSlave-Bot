In-depth Guide
by
Quincy#6965","OFF-FIELD DPS
High and Low Energy Recharge Requirements depends on the amount of Energy Recharge your Xingqiu needs. Choose wisely based on the team he's in and how easily you can achieve Energy Recharge targets. Other Hydro characters and Energy Recharge based teammates like Raiden Shogun can help alleviate his energy requirements, as does his Constellation 6.

Regarding Weapon Choices:
The weapon rankings assume you are running enough Energy Recharge to get Xingqiu's burst up off cooldown. If you are not, select an Energy Recharge weapon from this list.
Sacrificial Sword [R3+]: This weapon is extremely inconsistent and extends rotation lengths leading to an overall loss in DPS. This weapon does become more useful if Xingqiu is not the only hydro character on the team.
Harbinger of Dawn [R5]: At [C6], if you can consistently keep the passive active, this has the potential to rival Sacrificial Sword [R3+]
Sapwood Blade: This weapon can be especially useful as a support weapon in Dendro based teams.

Big thanks to Quincy#6965 for helping us with the weapon calculations.

Regarding Artifact Sets:
Emblem of Severed Fate (4): This set falls off in terms of damage if Xingqiu has less than 130% Energy Recharge.
Noblesse Oblige (4): Offers party-wide ATK boost, you can use this set on Xingqiu if nobody else on the party is able to use it better. If someone else on the team already has Noblesse Oblige (4), Noblesse Oblige (4) should not be used.
Blizzard Strayer (4): This set is only recommended on a freeze team to optimize Xingqiu's stats since he can mildly disregard Crit Rate and build Crit Damage instead for more damage output. Despite it outperforming Emblem of Severed Fate (4) within this niche, it is generally not recommended to specifically farm for this set.

Regarding Main Stats Priority:
Ideally you would be running ATK% Sands when your ER needs are fulfilled. ER needs can be found in the Xingqiu Mastersheet.",,,,,,

In-depth Guide from KQM","SUPPORT
Use Elemental Skill and/or Elemental Burst and immediately switch. Building ER is not recommended on Support Barbara as her burst should be used as a last resort and should not be expected to be cast every rotation. This is further compounded by the fact that Barbara has no particle generation. For this reason, Ocean-Hued Clam is also not recommended for Support Barbara.

Regarding Weapon Choices: 
Everlasting Moonglow: For Electro-Charged teams, this weapon will provide the highest personal damage for Barbara. However, Thrilling Tales of Dragon Slayers will still provide the highest team damage due to its 48 ATK% buff. 

Regarding Artifact Sets:
Maiden Beloved (4): This set is best acquired through the strongbox instead of trying to farm it in its domain.
Instructor (4): The Hydro application from Elemental Skill can be used to trigger an elemental reaction and provide a teamwide Elemental Mastery buff.

BLOOM DPS
This build is specifically for Bloom teams where Barbara is the character intended to trigger the majority of Blooms.

Regarding Aritfact Sets:
Ocean-Hued Clam (4): This set can do more damage than other options in certain situations, while also increasing Barbara's healing to deal with Bloom self-damage. However, this set is very resin inefficient and is thus not recommended to farm specifically for this set.",,,,,,

In-depth Guide 
from
Childe Mains","DPS
The Weapon Rankings here are under the assumption that Childe is used with Bennett and Vaporizes his Burst, aswell as using the optimal attack combos listed in the Ability Tips section.

Regarding Weapon Choices:
Polar Star: Has varied performance depending on how many passive stacks you get. Getting 2-3 stacks at the start of your rotation can perform better than Thundering Pulse while getting no stacks can perform worse than Skyward Harp.  This only applies if you are Vaporizing Childe Burst together with Bennett. In teams without Bennett, Polar Star will always perform better than the other options. 3 stacks can be achieved by doing Skill + 1 Normal + 1 Charged Attack before setting up your Vaporize Burst. If your Skill is still on cooldown, a fully Charged Aimed shot against a riptide affected target, OR a Ranged Normal + quick Aimed shot gives 2 stacks (which can be followed by Skill for the 3rd stack).
Thundering Pulse: Slightly better than Skyward Harp depending on rotations - the more time you spend doing Normal Attacks, the more it pulls ahead over Skyward Harp, but it's not recommended to extend your Childe's melee rotation for this.
The Viridescent Hunt: Offers a valuable passive that helps a lot in grouping enemies, which can offer a ton of damage from Riptide.
Blackcliff Warbow: Due to inconsistency of gaining stacks, falls off compared to other weapons at higher refinements.
Prototype Crescent: Requires you to trigger its passive by hitting the enemy's weak points, falls off if compared with other options without the passive triggered.
The Stringless: Main DPS Childe should only use this weapon in teams where you are Vaporizing your Burst, as the Elemental Mastery substat loses a lot of value in other teams. If Childe is being used as a Nuke Support only for his Vaporized Burst damage, R5 Stringless will rank just below Thundering Pulse. Note that the Stringless Elemental Skill passive does not affect Childe's melee stance auto attacks.

Regarding Artifact Sets:
Heart of Depth (2) +18% ATK set (2): This set is only about 1-2 substats behind Heart of Depth (4), you can opt out for this set instead if you already have decent pieces.
Shimenawa's Reminiscence (4): Due to this set requiring Childe to have around 150% Energy Recharge to reliably burst every rotation, it falls behind the other options. However, it outperforms Heart of Depth (4) if used in a single rotation setting (ignoring ER).",,,,,,

,NOTES,"DPS
This build is best utilised at [C2], but can work without it. Do note that several 4 stars will out-dps Mona, as Mona is better off as a Sub-DPS/Support.

NUKE
Mona's Elemental Skill provides taunt and procs wet status on enemies, her Elemental Burst is also capable of rendering smaller enemies immobile (Mona needs to be at least 20 levels within the enemy's level) and providing a huge damage burst (and additional omen debuff after proc).

Regarding Artifact Sets:
Instructor (4): A niche set only really used for certain Hu Tao teams nuke setups.

Look to the Nuke Mona's Ability Tip section for Vaporize Nuke set up instructions.

FREEZE SUPPORT
Mona's main role on a freeze team is to provide Omen debuff from her burst as it is extendable via Freeze mechanics. Note that you must apply Cryo before casting Mona's Elemental Burst for the extension to happen. Omen Freeze extension can be done by reapplying Cryo and Hydro aura consistently (this can be done with Cryo / Hydro infused Venti Elemental Burst + on-field Cryo / Hydro aura).

Regarding Weapon Choices:
Thrilling Tales of Dragon Slayers: Generally the best option on Freeze Support Mona because she can furthermore buff the ATK of your Main DPS. This however comes with an assumption that with Thrilling Tales of Dragon Slayers, you still have 100% Elemental Burst uptime. If you do not, pick the other Energy Recharge weapon options for more Elemental Burst uptime.

Regarding Artifact Sets:
Tenacity of the Millelith (4): Run this set if there's already another character with Noblesse Oblige (4) on the team.

from
Kokomi Mains + KQM","SUPPORT
Support Kokomi focuses on just using her Elemental Burst before her Elemental Skill's duration ends to refresh her skill duration. This allows 100% uptime on Hydro application from her Elemental Skill for Freeze / Electro-charge teams.

Regarding Weapon Choices:
Hakushin Ring: This weapon can provide Elemental DMG% for the team in Electro-charged teams and will outperform Prototype Amber if you value damage more than healing.
Sacrificial Fragments: Can be useful as Kokomi won't need to use her Elemental Burst to reset her skill duration. This allows for smoother rotations as she will not face the problem of missing out on the reset for her Elemental Skill due to not casting Burst in time.

Regarding Artifact Sets:
Tenacity of the Millelith (4): With proper extension of Kokomi's Elemental Skill, she can maintain near 100% uptime on this artifact set's 4 piece effect.
Ocean Hued Clam (4): This ranking assumes Kokomi is being used only for her Elemental Skill. If she is being used to attack onfield during Elemental Burst, this set may overtake Tenacity of the Millelith (4). 

Regarding Main Stats and Sub Stats: 
Energy Recharge: Prioritise Energy Recharge first to ensure you can always use Elemental Burst before the Elemental Skill expires in order to maintain Hydro application. 

DPS
DPS Kokomi aims to maximise her onfield damage during her Elemental Burst's duration. Outside of her Elemental Burst, her damage is lackluster and not worth building for.

Regarding Weapon Choices:
Thrilling Tales of Dragon Slayers: Although this weapon doesn't provide as much personal damage for Kokomi, the 48% ATK buff is usually more worth in most cases. This can be her best weapon in for overall team DPS if you don't already have another Thrilling Tales of Dragon Slayers user in your team.
Hakushin Ring: This weapon can provide Elemental DMG% for the team in Electro-charged teams, and is the best choice in those situations.

Regarding Artifact Sets:
Tenacity of the Millelith (4): Although this set offers the lowest personal damage for Kokomi, the 20% ATK team buff can sometimes be better for overall team DPS.

BLOOM DPS
This build is specifically for Bloom teams where Kokomi is the character intended to trigger the majority of Blooms.

Regarding Aritfact Sets:
Ocean-Hued Clam (4): This set can do more damage than other options in certain situations, while also increasing Kokomi's healing to deal with Bloom self-damage. However, this set is very resin inefficient and is thus not recommended to farm specifically for this set.",,,,,,

,"NOTES

In-Depth Guide
by KQM","DPS
DPS Ayato focuses on doing large amounts of on-field damage with his Elemental Skill and Elemental Burst. 

Regarding Weapon Choices:
Skyward Blade and Amenoma Kageuchi: If you are running Ayato in teams where he needs more than 140% ER to burst, these weapons can be quite valuable.
Summit Shaper: In teams where ATK buffs are scarce, this weapon has the potential to rival The Black Sword.
Lions Roar: In Electro-Charged teams, this weapon performs about equal to The Black Sword.

Regarding Artifact Sets:
Echoes of an Offering (4): The performance of this artifact set is inconsistent, and is based on user ping and other factors. It is not recommended to run this set unless your ping is consistently below 100. If you can achieve this, Echoes of an Offering (4) is only preferred on weapons with high amounts of DMG% such as Mistsplitter Reforged and Haran Geppaku Futsu. Otherwise, Heart of Depth (4) is preferred.
Blizzard Strayer (4): When run in a Freeze Team, this is Ayato's best set. Note that it is not recommended to farm specifically for this set.
Thundering Fury (4): When run in an Electro-Charged team, this is Ayato's best set due to the Cooldown Reduction on Elemental Skill allowing for shorter rotations. Note that it is not recommended to farm specifically for this set.",,,,,,

In-depth Guide 
from 
Yelan Mains","OFF-FIELD DPS
Yelan is an off-field DPS who is able to apply Hydro via her Elemental Burst, this part of her kit acts similarly to Xingqiu's Elemental Burst. Yelan mainly scales off HP%, so don't build her with ATK%. Yelan also wants a lot of Energy Recharge to be able to maintain her Elemental Burst uptime, this can decrease depending on the number of Hydro units or energy providers in the team.

Regarding Weapon Choices:
Elegy for the End: This weapon is to be used only in reaction based comps such as Vape Hu Tao, Yelan's personal damage is lower than other options on this list, but is more beneficial for the team's damage per rotation.
Mouun's Moon: This weapon works best at [R3+] and makes HP% Goblet potentially a stronger option instead of Hydro Bonus especially in comps with strong DMG% buffs.
Sacrificial Bow: This ideally needs to be at refinement [R3-R5] to function properly in most Yelan teams rotations without desyncing the rotation and extending her field time.
Aqua Simulacra: Can still perform well at high Energy Recharge as long as your minimum Energy Recharge requirements are met.
Hunter's Path / Polar Star / Thundering Pulse: These weapons are very potent on Yelan being some of her best DPS weapons, but she doesn't take full advantage of them. It is recommended to use them on characters who benefit more from their passives.

Regarding Artifact Main Stats:
Goblet: HP% Goblet is to be used only if the Hydro DMG% option has terrible substats and HP% option has great substats, or if Yelan has strong DMG% buffs such as Emblem of Severed Fate (4) + Mouun's Moon (especially with refinements) or Raiden + Kazuha and so on.
On top of that it's never recommended to run more than 2 HP% mainstat artifacts at a time.

Regarding Talent Priority:
Normal Attacks: Level this up only if you want to constantly use her Breakthrough Barbs.

,"NOTES


Quick Guide
from KQM","BLOOM SUPPORT
As a Bloom Support, Nilou's role is to maximize a team's Bloom Damage in teams of strictly Hydro and Dendro characters. Level 90 is highly recommended to maximize Nilou's HP and Bloom Damage

Regarding Weapon Choices:
Favonius Sword, Festering Desire and Sacrificial Sword: Strong options if opting to Burst every rotation. Favonius can potentially help other team members' energy needs. Do bear in mind though that Nilou strongly prefers Elemental Mastery weapons over Energy Recharge weapons in almost all circumstances.

Regarding Artifact Sets:
+80 Elemental Mastery set (2): These sets provide no benefit if Nilou isn't triggering Blooms.
+15% Hydro DMG set (2): This is only really a viable option if Nilou is played mostly on-field instead of off-field.
Deepwood Memories (4): Can be an option if other teammates are not Deepwood Memories holders.",,,,,,
